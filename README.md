# Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Analysis

## Project Description

- Cyclistic bike share is a bike share program that features bicycles and docking stations.

- They aim at making bike share inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike by producing different types of bikes.

- There are basically two types of riders; the casual riders and the annual members.
  
- The aim of the analysis is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

- Null and inconsistent values were dealt with.

## Data Verification

There were no null values, no incomplete columns, no duplicates, and no errors. All data was verified as clean.

## Results/Findings

-From the analysis, the following insights were discovered,

  - Casual riders use bikes more than the annual members.
    
   - The docked_bike is the most used bike.
     
  - The month of December has three types of bikes with docked_bike being the most used.
